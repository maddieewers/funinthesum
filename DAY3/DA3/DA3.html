        <p>
            The Border Collie is a breed of herding dog of medium size. Widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed, they are descendants of landrace sheepdogs that were once found all over the British Isles, but became standardised in the Anglo-Scottish border region. 
            They are now mostly used as working dogs to herd livestock, specifically sheep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Border Collies are extremely energetic, acrobatic, and athletic, frequently competing with great success in sheepdog trials and a range of dog sports like dog obedience, disc dog, herding and dog agility. 
            The breed continues to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world and are kept as pets.

    <h2 id="D">Description</h2>
        <p>
            Border Collies are, on average, medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is often thick and prone to shedding. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. 
            While black and white is the most common colouring of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, 
            and red tricolour (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. 
            Some border collies may also have single-colour coats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eye colour varies from brown to green, and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is usually seen with merles. This trait is known as heterochromia. The ears of the border collie are also variable â€” some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough collie). 
            Although working border collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog),in general, the American Border Collie Association considers a dog's appearance to be irrelevant.
            Instead, it is considered more useful to identify a working border collie by its attitude and ability.

    <h2 id="TN">Temperament and Needs</h2>
        <p>
            Border Collies require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. The border collie is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. The border collie ranks 1st in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being part of the top 10 brightest dogs.
            Although the primary role of the border collie is to herd livestock, the breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this role, due to their working heritage, border collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many border collies develop problematic behaviours in households that are not able to provide for their needs.
            They are infamous for chewing holes in walls and furniture, and for destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the border collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations.
            However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training.
        </p>
        <p>
            The American Border Collie Association recommends that potential owners, before taking on the breed as a household pet, should be sure they can provide regular exercise commensurate with the collie's high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality, and intelligence to control challenging livestock. These dogs will become distressed and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. 
            Like many working breeds, border collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behaviour can be modified by training.[10] Some of the more difficult behaviours require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.

        <h3>Life Span</h3>
            <p>
                The natural life span of the border collie is between 12 and 15 years, with an average lifespan of 12 years and the ability to live up to 18 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are usually 12 to 13 years.
                Leading causes of death are cancer (23.6%), old age (17.9%) and cerebral vascular afflictions (9.4%). Other conditions that occur more frequently in Border Collies than other breeds include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Collie eye Anomaly</li>
                    <li>Hip Dysplasia</li>
                    <li>Epilepsy</li>
                    <li>Hearing Loss</li>
                    <li>Elbow Dysplasia</li>
                    <li>Addison Disease</li>
                </ul>
           </p>
        <h3>Common Health Problems</h3>
            <p>
                Collie eye anomaly (CEA) and epilepsy are considered the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time.
                CEA is a congenital, inherited eye disease involving the retina, choroid, and sclera that sometimes affects border collies. In border collies, it is generally a mild disease and rarely significantly impairs vision. However other eye conditions such as PRA[15] slowly disintegrates the retina and can cause border collies to lose almost all of their vision at night which can progress into complete daytime blindness. 
                There is now a DNA test available for CEA and, through its use, breeders can ensure that they will not produce affected pups.

    <h2 id="Hi">History</h2>
    <p>
        The border collie is descended from landrace collies, a type found widely in the British Isles. The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border.
        Mention of the "collie" or "Colley" type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century, although the word "collie" is older than this and has its origin in the Scots language. It is also thought that the word 'collie' comes from the old Celtic word for useful. 
        Many of the best border collies today can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.
