    <p>Hey There! I'm Maddie Ewers.</p>
    <img src="/img/maddie.png" alt="Maddie Ewers" width="300" height="450">
    <p>^^ That's me!</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Dallas, TX and came up to CO for school at CU Boulder.</p>
    <p>My pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm what some would call "fun-sized" but I surely don't fall short with spunk!</p>
    <p>I love ceramic and sculpture work (did it in highschool) and it's become a hobbie/love over the years.</p>
    <p>Another thing I love is Brandi TV on Youtube...this is my favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKj57JzZD2g">video</a> of hers</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading a bit about me...let's getting to web-ing! :P</p>
